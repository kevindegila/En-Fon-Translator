Un@@ less o@@ ther@@ wise indic@@ ated , Scrip@@ ture qu@@ o@@ ta@@ tions are from the mo@@ der@@ n - language New World T@@ ran@@ sla@@ tion of the Ho@@ ly Scriptures .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - mean@@ ing family friend , but Be@@ be found it more cu@@ tting than comfor@@ ting .
“ His death w@@ as@@ n’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ dent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person was very close to the dec@@ e@@ ased .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly descri@@ bed as “ the last en@@ em@@ y . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ re@@ si@@ s@@ ti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are complet@@ ely un@@ pre@@ pa@@ red , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ m@@ un@@ e to its ra@@ va@@ ges .
So it is not surpris@@ ing if we feel at a lo@@ ss when it comes to co@@ p@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Perhaps you have won@@ dered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ acted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over Sarah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” sugg@@ ests that it took some time for him to co@@ pe with his lo@@ ss .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ i@@ gh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , died on Ju@@ ly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
Si@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my lo@@ ss of R@@ o@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ eve over my lo@@ ss .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjoyed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such p@@ ain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only n@@ at@@ ur@@ al .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tr@@ ag@@ ed@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to lo@@ ss se@@ ems exc@@ es@@ sive .
As we no@@ te in the “ I@@ m@@ itate Their F@@ a@@ ith ” article in this issue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For in@@ stance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to c@@ ry or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the opp@@ osi@@ te and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more bal@@ an@@ ced view , one that is suppor@@ ted by mo@@ der@@ n re@@ sear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tures it is considered un@@ man@@ ly for a mal@@ e to c@@ ry .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ med about she@@ d@@ ding te@@ ars , even in public ?
M@@ en@@ tal - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on despite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your lo@@ ss .
Su@@ p@@ pres@@ sing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible l@@ ends no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed te@@ ars of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly we@@ pt , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of su@@ d@@ den , un@@ expected death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when though@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ oun@@ ded comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ can man named Mi@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the An@@ g@@ li@@ can minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ speci@@ ally in the case of un@@ expected death , the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ ra@@ tional feelings are common to many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved ones .
The Bible re@@ min@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dis@@ tre@@ ss . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he ca@@ res for you . ”
Mo@@ re@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings s@@ oo@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Also , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
Ha@@ ving such thoughts to p@@ on@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ ov@@ ed wife to can@@ c@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wa@@ ke up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and med@@ it@@ ating on comfor@@ ting thoughts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ cen@@ ding peace come over me , pu@@ tting my mind and heart at re@@ st and en@@ abl@@ ing me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman named V@@ an@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God’s name and bre@@ ak down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah listen@@ ed to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some b@@ ere@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with gri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to volun@@ te@@ er their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’s gri@@ ef .
Many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God fe@@ els for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently listen@@ s to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of a loved one ?
S@@ ome@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we win@@ d up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practical , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a sim@@ ple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a gen@@ tle s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an eff@@ ective way to show you care .
If the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as c@@ oo@@ king a me@@ al , c@@ aring for the children , or helping with fun@@ er@@ al arrang@@ ements if that is desi@@ red .
Such actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ e@@ ased , perhaps foc@@ using on some good qualities or happy experien@@ ces .
Such conver@@ s@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mil@@ e to the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person@@ ’s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ag@@ o — ​ says : “ People some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers repor@@ t that many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved people receive a lo@@ t of ini@@ ti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get b@@ us@@ y again with their own lives .
There@@ fore , make a point of con@@ t@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved friend on a regular ba@@ sis after the lo@@ ss .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones dee@@ ply appreciate this opportunity to reli@@ eve themselves of pro@@ long@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ or@@ i , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was de@@ va@@ stated by the lo@@ ss of her mother follow@@ ed by the lo@@ ss of her older sister 15 months later .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loyal friends .
One named R@@ it@@ su@@ ko is much older than K@@ a@@ or@@ i and o@@ ffered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ or@@ i , “ I w@@ as@@ n’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ ko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She invited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and c@@ ards many times .
Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ k@@ o@@ ’s posi@@ tive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since K@@ a@@ ori@@ ’s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ers .
“ Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ ko , ” K@@ a@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
Ano@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ o@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian she@@ ph@@ er@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wi@@ do@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ adly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ o@@ s died of a b@@ ra@@ in tu@@ m@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ alls P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not stop them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ rac@@ ing us with their kind words and practical help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to inclu@@ de Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practical help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also comfor@@ ts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a re@@ min@@ der to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the lo@@ ss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned earlier in this seri@@ es , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ o@@ b .
However , she is loo@@ king forward to see@@ ing him again in God’s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aware of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a paradise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be am@@ az@@ ed at this , ” Jesus assu@@ res us , “ for the h@@ our is coming in which all those in the m@@ emorial t@@ om@@ bs will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the prosp@@ ect of re@@ ga@@ in@@ ing “ his y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful vi@@ g@@ or , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ fre@@ sh@@ er than in y@@ outh . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who respond with appreciation to God’s mer@@ ci@@ ful provi@@ sion of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have su@@ ffered the lo@@ ss of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not complet@@ ely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by med@@ it@@ ating on God’s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 13 .

In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the N@@ az@@ ar@@ en@@ e was ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y char@@ ged with se@@ dition , sa@@ va@@ g@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a st@@ ake .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ cen@@ ded to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four Go@@ sp@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ esta@@ ment .
On the other hand , if those events really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Go@@ sp@@ el accoun@@ ts fact or fi@@ ction ?
Un@@ like f@@ anci@@ ful le@@ gen@@ ds , the Go@@ sp@@ el writ@@ ings reflect p@@ ain@@ st@@ aking accur@@ ac@@ y and attention to de@@ ta@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be visi@@ ted today .
They tell about real people , whose ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ ori@@ ans . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second cen@@ tu@@ ries .
* His man@@ ner of death , as descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els , agre@@ es with Roman ex@@ ecu@@ tional me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of the time .
Mo@@ re@@ over , events are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tr@@ aying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ a@@ bly .
All these fac@@ tors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the Go@@ sp@@ el writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and accur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the ini@@ ti@@ al repor@@ t of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occa@@ sions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 e@@ ye@@ w@@ itnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ rest@@ ed and kill@@ ed , the disciples courag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ecu@@ ted him .
Would so many disciples have been so bo@@ ld if they were not ab@@ sol@@ u@@ t@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the d@@ ri@@ ving for@@ ce be@@ hin@@ d the im@@ p@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The Go@@ sp@@ el accoun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessary mar@@ ks of an auth@@ en@@ tic hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will conv@@ in@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your con@@ vi@@ ction can be fu@@ r@@ ther strength@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ tu@@ s , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , su@@ ffered the ex@@ tre@@ me pen@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ us at the hands of one of our pro@@ cur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hist@@ ori@@ an Josep@@ hus ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Youn@@ ger , gover@@ nor of B@@ i@@ th@@ y@@ ni@@ a ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many opp@@ os@@ ers would writ@@ e anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility to the repor@@ ts about him .
Re@@ garding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allowed him to become mani@@ f@@ est , not to all the people , but to w@@ itnesses appointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’s Go@@ sp@@ el tel@@ ls us that when the religious en@@ emi@@ es heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they s@@ ch@@ em@@ ed to su@@ p@@ pres@@ s them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ dered us to preach to the people and to give a th@@ or@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tru@@ e Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
M@@ ost people would pro@@ ba@@ bly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of life , they say , the n@@ at@@ ur@@ al out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
Su@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Un@@ der nor@@ ma@@ l circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put eter@@ nity in their heart . ” ​ — E@@ c@@ cle@@ si@@ ast@@ es 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ med@@ y the situation ?
The Bible’s answers are hear@@ ten@@ ing , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ aring on why Jesus su@@ ffered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the prosp@@ ect of un@@ en@@ ding life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account descri@@ b@@ es how they fa@@ iled to obey God and lost that prosp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ kl@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the Go@@ sp@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ tu@@ al , hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’s fa@@ il@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life and even@@ tually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to re@@ med@@ y the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ ements to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The w@@ ages sin p@@ ays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ sequ@@ ence of sin .
Li@@ kewise , we sin and are there@@ fore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’s w@@ ages , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ul@@ t of our own .
So God lo@@ v@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the w@@ ages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even till death was needed to rele@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necessary for Jesus to die to accompl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ ghty God have simply issu@@ ed a dec@@ re@@ e that Ad@@ am@@ ’s des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants be allowed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice a@@ side in this in@@ stance , people might have won@@ dered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’s off@@ sp@@ ring quali@@ fy for eter@@ n@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tru@@ sted to keep his promises ?
God’s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our sal@@ vation is assu@@ rance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrifi@@ cial death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ adise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recor@@ ded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of God’s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing justice but , more speci@@ ally , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to su@@ ff@@ er and die in the p@@ ain@@ ful way that was descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els ?
By sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and remain@@ ing faithful , Jesus refu@@ ted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have se@@ em@@ ed v@@ ali@@ d after Satan in@@ duc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’s perfect e@@ qui@@ v@@ al@@ ent — ​ remain@@ ed obedi@@ ent despite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus pro@@ ved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God rewar@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’s perfect obedi@@ ence , gran@@ ting Jesus immor@@ tal life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

Do not be anxi@@ ous , for I am your God .
During an ass@@ em@@ bly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the territory , and he gave me some boo@@ k@@ le@@ ts about God’s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjoyed giving people hope from God’s Word .
The brother st@@ opp@@ ed his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to si@@ t down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
L@@ et@@ ’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”

After three we@@ e@@ ks I pro@@ pos@@ ed , and after si@@ x we@@ e@@ ks we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were assigned as mission@@ ari@@ es to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ico , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .

Why does God want you to use your power of reason ?
( Read Romans 12 : 1 , 2 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 4 . )

Our children ac@@ qui@@ re it little by little . ”
He as@@ ks : ‘ What does the Bible say ? ’
‘ Do you believe what it says ? ’
He wants me to answer in my own words and not simply re@@ pe@@ at his or M@@ u@@ m@@ ’s words .
As I got older , I had to exp@@ and on my answers . ”
They ans@@ wer@@ ed all my questions , using the Bible . ”
( Read De@@ u@@ ter@@ on@@ om@@ y 6 : 5 - 8 ; Luke 6 : 45 . )
So if life ev@@ ol@@ ved from sim@@ ple to more com@@ ple@@ x form@@ s , why were these ancient cre@@ at@@ u@@ res already so com@@ ple@@ x ?
It was a lesson that dee@@ ply im@@ pres@@ sed me and that I sha@@ red with my son . ”

“ They took great care , ” she explained .
“ When I asked them why they were so care@@ ful , they said that they wanted the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e to be just the way I like it .
I explained that God mi@@ x@@ ed the g@@ as@@ es in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere with similar care ​ — just right for us . ”
And how would you comp@@ are the s@@ ound of an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e to the sing@@ ing of a bir@@ d ?
So who is more in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent ​ — the ma@@ k@@ er of a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es or the Creator of bir@@ ds ? ”
( Read Psalm 1 : 1 - 3 . )
“ N@@ ever ti@@ re of ex@@ per@@ im@@ en@@ ting with new ways to appro@@ ach old sub@@ j@@ ects , ” said one father .
“ From the time they were very young , I stu@@ died with them for 15 min@@ u@@ tes every day , exc@@ ept on days when we had Christian meetings .
O@@ ver time , many of these were ad@@ dre@@ ssed at meetings or during family or personal study .
Th@@ at@@ ’s why it@@ ’s important for parents just to keep teaching . ”
Let your children see how real Jehovah is to you .
“ We also tell our older daughter , ‘ Have complete trust in Jehovah , keep b@@ us@@ y in Kingdom service , and do not wor@@ ry too much . ’
When she se@@ es the out@@ come , she knows that Jehovah is helping us .
This has done won@@ ders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
Let me explain what led to that conver@@ s@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on D@@ ec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ d@@ est of four children .
Then a soldi@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ c@@ tor y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The soldi@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and so@@ b@@ er up ! ”
He o@@ w@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ ber@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a , and the do@@ c@@ tor was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a convention in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehovah’s blessing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also so@@ ld my car for $ 25 .
We were assigned to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ nu@@ t Ri@@ d@@ ge , Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
Then in 196@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ itation to the 3@@ 7@@ th cl@@ as@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad .
In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Ch@@ r@@ is Kan@@ a@@ iy@@ a
So@@ on after , our first daughter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Ste@@ ph@@ any .
We would also go cam@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able conver@@ sa@@ tions around the cam@@ p@@ fi@@ re .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to c@@ ry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God’s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly met one of his work@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ l@@ y@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were invited to work at L@@ on@@ d@@ on Bethel and later were trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to Mal@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ du@@ ca@@ tional C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , Lin@@ da called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to raise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ e and Eli@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h .
Paul and Ste@@ ph@@ any are still in Mal@@ aw@@ i , where Paul ser@@ ves on the B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?
When I left the a@@ ir@@ por@@ t and felt the co@@ ld for the first time in my life , I started c@@ r@@ ying . ”

Are you among those who are learning another language ?
( Read Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah 13 : 23 , 24 . )
( b ) How can we reach our goal ?
We must recogniz@@ e that when we pre@@ pare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an in@@ tel@@ l@@ ec@@ tu@@ al exerc@@ ise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily tou@@ ched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I regularly set a@@ side time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e . ”

But we also inclu@@ de prac@@ tice s@@ es@@ sions and g@@ ames in L@@ ing@@ al@@ a so that they can learn this language while having fun . ”
Ma@@ ke an effort to learn the local language and to par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the meetings ( See paragrap@@ h@@ s 16 , 17 )

In what ways must we exerc@@ ise our faith ?
( b ) What questions will we now consider ?
In what two ways does Hebre@@ ws 11 : 1 descri@@ be faith ?
You see that his faith was ac@@ tive along with his works and his faith was perf@@ ected by his works . ”
For example , John explained : “ The one who exerc@@ is@@ es faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who dis@@ obe@@ y@@ s the Son will not see life , but the wr@@ ath of God remain@@ s up@@ on him . ”
Com@@ pa@@ red with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God choose those who are po@@ or from the worl@@ d’s stand@@ point to be ri@@ ch in faith and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ”

What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ?
Would the Israelites ever again be able to worship God in a complet@@ ely accep@@ table way ?
So it does not really se@@ em that Jehovah’s people enter@@ ed into cap@@ tivity to Babylon the Gre@@ at in 19@@ 18 .
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 9 , 10 . )
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 39 . )
Would true Christians ever be free to worship God op@@ en@@ ly and accep@@ ta@@ bly ?
When were the anointed fre@@ ed from Babyl@@ oni@@ an cap@@ tivity ?
Brother Ru@@ ther@@ for@@ d re@@ ques@@ ted that we arrang@@ e conven@@ tions in sever@@ al ci@@ ties in the w@@ es@@ ter@@ n Un@@ ited St@@ ates and s@@ end spe@@ ak@@ ers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible . ”
“ If you have any word of encouragement for the people , tell it . ” ​ — A@@ C@@ T@@ S 13 : 15 .
So I c@@ ry often and pre@@ f@@ er not to talk to them .
He listen@@ ed with sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy as I expres@@ sed my feelings .
Then he re@@ min@@ ded me of the good I was accompl@@ ish@@ ing .
He also re@@ min@@ ded me of Jesus ’ words ​ — that each of us is wor@@ th more than many sp@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws .
I often rec@@ all that scrip@@ ture , and it still tou@@ ches my heart .

What can we learn from the way Jehovah , Jesus , and Paul encouraged others ?
( Read E@@ c@@ cle@@ si@@ ast@@ es 4 : 9 , 10 . )
What can we learn from the way Jesus tre@@ ated his apostles ?
After going through those re@@ gi@@ ons and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there , he arri@@ ved in Gre@@ ec@@ e . ”

( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 2 : 13 . )
The Bible direc@@ ts us to attend meetings regularly .
Have you been using jw.org in your ministry and in your family worship ?
and the bro@@ c@@ hu@@ re Who Are Do@@ ing Jehovah’s Will Today ?
What are some reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah ?
There are many reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
I was only ei@@ ght years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was cu@@ ri@@ ous and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the bre@@ thre@@ n ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
He said , “ G@@ o for it ! ”
After four months , I sel@@ ected a brother as my pioneer par@@ t@@ ner .
My mother pione@@ ered with a sister in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I fill@@ ed out an ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation to attend the Watchtower Bible School of G@@ ile@@ ad .
While there , I received my inv@@ itation to the 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d cl@@ as@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad .
I then travel@@ ed by tr@@ ain to S@@ outh L@@ ans@@ ing , New York , where the school was loc@@ ated .
With J@@ an@@ et on one of the many is@@ lands in the Philipp@@ ines
We still serve at the branch office in Qu@@ e@@ z@@ on C@@ ity
How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to re@@ duce anxiety ?
( See op@@ ening pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psal@@ mis@@ t David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ L@@ is@@ ten to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxi@@ ous , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be anxi@@ ous ” ?
He ad@@ mit@@ ted : “ My an@@ gu@@ ished heart makes me gro@@ an al@@ ou@@ d . ”
( See the bo@@ x “ Some P@@ rac@@ tical W@@ ays to Re@@ duce An@@ xi@@ ety . ” )
How can the mean@@ ing of God’s name strengthen your faith ?
His very name is under@@ stood to mean “ He C@@ a@@ uses to Bec@@ ome . ”
“ An@@ xi@@ ety in a man@@ ’s heart we@@ i@@ gh@@ s it down , but a good word c@@ he@@ ers it up . ”
Why can you be confi@@ dent that your relationship with God will strengthen you ?
( a ) How can we th@@ ro@@ w our anxiety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah rewar@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah bl@@ ess his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith con@@ n@@ ected ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewar@@ ded for their sacrifi@@ ces ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ oun@@ t , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your reward is great in the heaven@@ s , for in that way they pers@@ ecu@@ ted the proph@@ ets pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely bl@@ ess you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to pos@@ s@@ ess as an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obey the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully ob@@ serve all this comman@@ d@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bl@@ ess you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my aff@@ li@@ ction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endu@@ red a t@@ or@@ ture st@@ ake , desp@@ is@@ ing sha@@ me . ”

The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sel@@ y with Jehovah , I feel sec@@ ure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrifi@@ ces for him , he gives me back a hun@@ dre@@ d@@ fo@@ ld in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with scrip@@ tures and thoughts from our publications that I can con@@ su@@ l@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ courag@@ ement is tem@@ por@@ ary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”

( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 . )
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , 7 . )

THE very first words of the Bible make this sim@@ ple but pro@@ found st@@ at@@ ement : “ In the beg@@ in@@ ning God created the heaven@@ s and the earth . ”
( c ) What questions will we consider ?
And why is Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the key that un@@ loc@@ ks the do@@ or for God’s purpose to be accompl@@ ished ?
What are some gi@@ f@@ ts that Jehovah gave Adam and Eve ?
It was as if he were saying : ‘ You mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never viol@@ ates them .
( Read De@@ u@@ ter@@ on@@ om@@ y 32 : 4 , 5 . )

This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah vie@@ wed those k@@ ings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
We lived on a small f@@ ar@@ m in e@@ ast@@ er@@ n S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ o@@ ta .
F@@ ar@@ m@@ ing was an important part of our fam@@ il@@ y@@ ’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 19@@ 34 .
My d@@ ad , C@@ lar@@ ence , and later my un@@ c@@ le Al@@ f@@ red , served as comp@@ any servant ( now called co@@ or@@ din@@ ator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Con@@ de , S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ o@@ ta .
My sister , D@@ or@@ othy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were si@@ x .
Con@@ ven@@ tions and ass@@ em@@ bli@@ es were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one wal@@ king with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who suppor@@ ted my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations ne@@ ar@@ by , they some@@ times invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Be@@ th@@ el@@ ite , with a f@@ ar@@ m tru@@ ck
The f@@ ar@@ m on St@@ at@@ en Is@@ land inclu@@ ded the ra@@ di@@ o st@@ ation W@@ B@@ B@@ R .
On@@ ly 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the f@@ ar@@ m .
M@@ ost of us were young and qu@@ ite in@@ experienced .
Brother Pet@@ er@@ son did his work at Bethel well but never ne@@ gl@@ ected the field ministry .
With An@@ g@@ el@@ a in 19@@ 7@@ 5 , before a tel@@ evi@@ sion inter@@ view
Th@@ re@@ e years later , we were invited to Bethel .
Why do Jehovah and Christ deser@@ ve to be hon@@ o@@ red ?
Hu@@ man@@ s were created “ in God’s im@@ age . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehovah’s Witnesses view govern@@ ment offi@@ ci@@ als ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )
Mo@@ re@@ over , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
N@@ ei@@ ther be called lead@@ ers , for your Le@@ ad@@ er is one , the Christ .
But the greatest one among you must be your minis@@ ter .
W@@ ho@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be hum@@ bl@@ ed , and who@@ ever hum@@ bl@@ es himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . ”
( Read Hebre@@ ws 13 : 7 , 17 . )
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read James 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
L@@ ov@@ ing elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
El@@ ders too should take time to do re@@ sear@@ ch .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah exp@@ ect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Wh@@ ich of the four k@@ ings would you like to imitate , and why ?

Why will we consider the examples of four k@@ ings of Jud@@ ah ?
( Read 2 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that N@@ ec@@ ho@@ ’s words were “ from the m@@ outh of God . ”
Let us med@@ itate on these Bible accoun@@ ts and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vo@@ w or your marriage vo@@ w ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experienced or ob@@ served an injustice , our faith , humility , and loy@@ al@@ ty may be t@@ ested .
“ The world is pas@@ sing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remain@@ s forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and cor@@ ru@@ pt organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pas@@ sing away . ”
There is no d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness or deep sha@@ do@@ w where wr@@ ong@@ do@@ ers can con@@ ce@@ al themselves . ”
Later in the same psal@@ m , we read : “ The righteous will pos@@ s@@ ess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the me@@ ek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organiz@@ ed ?
After Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ d@@ on , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organiz@@ ed .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family aff@@ ected ?
What do we learn from Jehovah’s judgment of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h ?

What are some things that will be g@@ one forever after Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ d@@ on ?
I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ W@@ I@@ L@@ L the Jud@@ ge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians exp@@ ect to experience some injustice out@@ side the Christian congregation .
In 194@@ 6 , he atten@@ ded the ei@@ gh@@ th cl@@ as@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad School in New York , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
After gr@@ adu@@ ation , he was even@@ tually assigned to the circuit work in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?

10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ jus@@ tic@@ es did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mis@@ take .
M@@ ost important , he did not allow the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions and wrong actions of others to se@@ par@@ ate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See W@@ il@@ li Di@@ e@@ hl@@ ’s life st@@ ory , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will T@@ r@@ ust , ” in the N@@ ov@@ ember 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Watchtower .

( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
S@@ p@@ eci@@ al full - time service vo@@ w ( See paragraph 19 )

( b ) How did Israel de@@ fe@@ at J@@ ab@@ in@@ ’s ar@@ my ?
( Read Jud@@ ges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The t@@ or@@ r@@ ent of K@@ is@@ ho@@ n w@@ as@@ h@@ ed them away . ”

( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was N@@ abo@@ th , and why did he ref@@ use to sell his v@@ in@@ e@@ y@@ ard to King A@@ ha@@ b ?
N@@ abo@@ th was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King A@@ ha@@ b and his wife , wicked Qu@@ e@@ en Je@@ ze@@ be@@ l .
Read 1 K@@ ings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He resp@@ ec@@ t@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , from Jehovah’s stand@@ point , for me to give you the in@@ her@@ it@@ ance of my fore@@ fa@@ thers . ”
Why would humility have been a prot@@ ection to N@@ abo@@ th@@ ’s family and friends ?
( Read De@@ u@@ ter@@ on@@ om@@ y 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders ann@@ oun@@ ce a decision that you do not agre@@ e with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter correc@@ ted , and what questions ar@@ ise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to writ@@ e two let@@ ters that became part of the Bible .
3 H@@ el@@ p@@ ing “ F@@ o@@ re@@ ign Re@@ si@@ dents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consi@@ ders how ap@@ pl@@ ying Bible principles will help im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people r@@ un@@ ning , sho@@ o@@ ting .
My parents and 11 of us si@@ bl@@ ings fl@@ ed for our lives with only the clo@@ th@@ es on our bac@@ ks .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refu@@ ge@@ es ?
He said : “ When they pers@@ ecu@@ te you in one city , f@@ lee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a cam@@ p ?
My fe@@ et were so s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to ab@@ and@@ on me to the re@@ be@@ l for@@ ces — ​ c@@ arri@@ ed me .
They g@@ os@@ si@@ p@@ ed , d@@ ran@@ k , g@@ am@@ bl@@ ed , st@@ ol@@ e , and were immor@@ al . ”

( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refu@@ ge@@ es show gra@@ titude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refu@@ ge@@ es ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do refu@@ ge@@ es need to re@@ si@@ st ?
Fin@@ ally , he held up the em@@ p@@ ty ba@@ g and said with a s@@ mil@@ e : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of to@@ d@@ ay@@ ’s refu@@ ge@@ es come from coun@@ tri@@ es where our preaching work is re@@ stri@@ c@@ ted .
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close rela@@ tives , provi@@ ding food , clo@@ th@@ es , s@@ hel@@ ter , and tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ tation .
Who else would wel@@ come str@@ ang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refu@@ g@@ ee arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in O@@ r@@ ganiz@@ ed to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a refu@@ ge@@ e’s congregation and ministry to dis@@ cer@@ n his spiritual con@@ dition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on wal@@ king in the truth . ” ​ — 3 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 4 .

How can others help im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ f@@ er the local language .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in a few years , the shi@@ ft was complete .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n’@@ t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n’@@ t identi@@ fy with my parents ’ cul@@ ture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ see@@ king first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so b@@ us@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that descri@@ b@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the local language ?
A child who comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ates best in another spo@@ ken language deser@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not agre@@ e ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pray@@ ing , and doing her best to conduct family worship every we@@ ek , we under@@ stood that g@@ etting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must deci@@ de which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were g@@ etting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ g@@ ether , we regularly atten@@ ded meetings and sha@@ red in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Li@@ fe was very b@@ us@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifi@@ ces .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the ba@@ si@@ c@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language spo@@ ken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ ris@@ tin@@ a .
“ When I was 12 , I atten@@ ded a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ stood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Ano@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opportu@@ ni@@ ties to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ’s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See paragrap@@ h@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the le@@ is@@ ure activities we sha@@ red in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it w@@ as@@ n’@@ t until 194@@ 6 that I really under@@ stood Bible truth .
E@@ ven@@ tually , I learned si@@ gn language and had fun pl@@ aying with the other children .
She accepted a mag@@ az@@ ine sub@@ scrip@@ tion and wanted me to meet her husband , G@@ ary .
E@@ ven@@ tually , fi@@ ve from their cl@@ as@@ s became Jehovah’s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a pi@@ ec@@ e of c@@ and@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 196@@ 0 , her parents did not come to our we@@ d@@ ding .

We are now part of the C@@ al@@ g@@ ary S@@ ign - L@@ an@@ gu@@ age Con@@ gre@@ gation , where I continue to serve as an elder .
How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we de@@ ep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to grow co@@ ld ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first comman@@ d@@ ment . ”
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 1@@ 19 : 9@@ 7 - 1@@ 00 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new comman@@ d@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ u@@ l it in because of the large number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able lesson did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally reali@@ zed that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After plan@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a stre@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sell ice cre@@ am .
In the beg@@ in@@ ning , I stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ed fin@@ anci@@ ally and got dis@@ courag@@ ed .
When I met my form@@ er work@@ mat@@ es , they would la@@ u@@ gh at me and ask why I thought sel@@ ling ice cre@@ am was better than working with com@@ pu@@ ters in an a@@ ir - con@@ di@@ tioned en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to co@@ pe and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ’ ta@@ st@@ es and became more s@@ kill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I worked with com@@ pu@@ ters .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the stre@@ ss and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I reali@@ zed that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happiness than pursu@@ ing the enter@@ tain@@ ment o@@ ffered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Wh@@ ere your tre@@ asure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”
He ad@@ ded : “ You cannot slave for God and for Ri@@ ches . ”

( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Be@@ th@@ el@@ ites , pioneers , and elders .
I@@ ren@@ e says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursu@@ ed , I can@@ ’@@ t imag@@ ine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ tre@@ asure st@@ ore ” that Jesus refer@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 5@@ 2 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the r@@ ab@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and ch@@ ec@@ ked the Watchtower and Aw@@ ake !
mag@@ az@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous months , I found an article explain@@ ing that Daniel was written in Ar@@ am@@ a@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ tre@@ asure in the heaven@@ s , where no thi@@ ef g@@ ets near and no mo@@ th con@@ su@@ m@@ es .
For where your tre@@ asure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had tr@@ ou@@ ble g@@ etting along with a brother who worked with me .
On@@ ce when we were y@@ el@@ ling at each other , two people came in and w@@ itness@@ ed our bl@@ o@@ w@@ u@@ p . ” ​ — C@@ H@@ R@@ I@@ S .
“ A sister with whom I often pre@@ ached su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ended our arrang@@ ements for the ministry .
I had no ide@@ a why . ” ​ — J@@ AN@@ E@@ T .
“ I was on a three - person ph@@ one call .

As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being cur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deser@@ ve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began see@@ ing my own personality f@@ laws , and I was very dis@@ appointed in my@@ self .
I reali@@ zed that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After pray@@ ing to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ought the sister a small gift and wrote her a c@@ ard to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ gg@@ ed each other and agre@@ ed to put the matter be@@ hin@@ d us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
F@@ O@@ R many people today , money is the bi@@ g issue .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be set@@ t@@ led ?
How important is the v@@ indic@@ ation of Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
Why , from the day our fore@@ fa@@ thers f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep in death , all things are continu@@ ing ex@@ ac@@ tly as they were from cre@@ a@@ tion@@ ’s beg@@ in@@ ning . ”

What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expres@@ s how he fe@@ els , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I don@@ ’@@ t feel qu@@ ite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ R@@ ec@@ ei@@ ving a shor@@ t encourag@@ ing message or an inv@@ itation to sp@@ end time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those expres@@ sions make me feel loved and ca@@ red for . ”
“ S@@ ome@@ times when sisters have come to comfort me , ” rec@@ alls D@@ al@@ en@@ e , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .

“ O@@ f@@ ten the help and comp@@ ani@@ on@@ ship o@@ ffered when there is no special an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary can be very ben@@ e@@ fi@@ cial , ” explains J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous m@@ om@@ ents are so valu@@ able and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving ar@@ ms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a sour@@ ce of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the S@@ overei@@ gn Lord Jehovah will wi@@ pe away the te@@ ars from all fac@@ es . ”
O@@ ther scrip@@ tures that many have found comfor@@ ting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1@@ 21 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Philipp@@ i@@ ans 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ ba@@ bly agre@@ e that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
Li@@ fe is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his im@@ age . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also dre@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fai@@ l when there is no con@@ su@@ l@@ tation , but there is accompl@@ ish@@ ment through many adv@@ is@@ ers . ”
As with any care@@ er , you need time to become s@@ kill@@ ed .
At first , I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n’@@ t start any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another territory , and with@@ in a mon@@ th I started sever@@ al stu@@ dies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , J@@ ac@@ o@@ b , from N@@ or@@ th A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , writ@@ es : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es were V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese .

I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
Later , I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are am@@ az@@ ed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progre@@ ssed to baptism . ” ​ — Com@@ pare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encourag@@ ing the young brothers in our congregation and see@@ ing their spiritual progress .
After I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
I@@ t’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progre@@ ssed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportu@@ ni@@ ties ?
A brother named K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
Fin@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I suppor@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .

The second article high@@ li@@ gh@@ ts how Jehovah can do the un@@ expected by accompl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never imag@@ ine .
Like the f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gran@@ d@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and J@@ ac@@ o@@ b were born ( See paragrap@@ h@@ s 9 , 10 )

What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arri@@ ved in M@@ ac@@ e@@ don@@ i@@ a , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and Sil@@ as started “ pray@@ ing and p@@ ra@@ is@@ ing God with s@@ ong . ”

( b ) How did Paul’s situation change un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discuss and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in harmon@@ y with our prayers .
S@@ ome@@ times he surpris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expected .
Jehovah sent an angel to destro@@ y 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b@@ ’s soldi@@ ers in one night .

No doubt Jehovah’s actions ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ded all of Josep@@ h’s exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
Th@@ ink , too , about Josep@@ h’s great - gran@@ d@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 4@@ 3 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah ca@@ res for us and wants us to suc@@ ce@@ ed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old personality ?

He says : “ Our family life im@@ pro@@ ved dr@@ am@@ a@@ tic@@ ally .
Today , Ste@@ ph@@ en ser@@ ves as a minis@@ ter@@ i@@ al servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for sever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encouraged me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ pare for and attend congregation meetings .

What example did Jesus set in showing mil@@ dness and patience ?
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue showing fav@@ ori@@ ti@@ sm , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been co@@ p@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lo@@ t of stre@@ ss .
I conclu@@ ded that she pro@@ ba@@ bly did not really mean what she wrote .

It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and re@@ sour@@ ces in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .

“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .

All of a su@@ d@@ den , it d@@ aw@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .

Your S@@ on@@ ’s sacrifice is not en@@ ough to c@@ over me . ’
It was as if I had been th@@ ro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .

I should feel free to do the same .
So I@@ ’@@ ll men@@ tion something in pas@@ sing , such as , ‘ I was teaching the Bible the other day , and . . . ’
Then I continue with the point of my st@@ ory .
Although the im@@ me@@ di@@ ate point is not in it@@ self about the Bible , often others are cu@@ ri@@ ous about what I do when teaching the Bible .
The more I use this appro@@ ach , the easi@@ er it g@@ ets .

We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ pos@@ ed to .
So the way we act can determin@@ e how they will respond .
What if we are sh@@ y or ti@@ mi@@ d or have a hard time speaking up about our faith , or what if we c@@ r@@ ing@@ e when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we ar@@ en@@ ’@@ t pr@@ ou@@ d of who we are .
They may even respond un@@ kin@@ dly because of our l@@ ack of confidence .
However , if we talk with e@@ ase and assu@@ rance about what we believe , making it a nor@@ ma@@ l part of conver@@ s@@ ation , it@@ ’s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him dis@@ own himself and pic@@ k up his t@@ or@@ ture st@@ ake and keep following me . ”

If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the ba@@ sis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you re@@ pen@@ ted of your sins and dedic@@ ated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospit@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writ@@ es : “ I he@@ si@@ t@@ ated ini@@ ti@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .

There stood a Bible stud@@ ent who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .
She had come to wel@@ come the new mission@@ ari@@ es .
We invited her in and gave her a gl@@ as@@ s of water .
If you feel anxi@@ ous about having gu@@ ests , you are not alone .
A@@ n elder in B@@ rit@@ ain ad@@ m@@ its : “ There can be a me@@ asure of n@@ er@@ v@@ ousness in pre@@ par@@ ing for gu@@ ests .
But as with anything in rela@@ tion to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satis@@ fac@@ tion that result far out@@ we@@ i@@ gh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply si@@ tting down with gu@@ ests over co@@ f@@ fe@@ e and tal@@ king . ”
Ano@@ ther elder writ@@ es : “ Ha@@ ving friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instruc@@ tors really put me at e@@ ase .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best we@@ e@@ ks are those sp@@ ent st@@ aying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and ke@@ eping life sim@@ ple .
This re@@ min@@ ded me of what my mu@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ Bet@@ ter a dis@@ h of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es where ther@@ e’s love . ’ ”

The elder rec@@ all@@ ed : “ G@@ raha@@ m had a problem with pri@@ de .
He was cri@@ tical of the elders who had been involved in his dis@@ fel@@ low@@ shipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stu@@ dies , we discus@@ sed scrip@@ tures on pri@@ de and its eff@@ ects .
G@@ raha@@ m began to see himself clearly in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ing that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pri@@ de and that his cri@@ tical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word ear@@ n@@ es@@ tly , and to make da@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .

Some years later , the daughter was re@@ in@@ stated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze me , but they encouraged me and strength@@ ened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how b@@ us@@ y they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of God’s love .
T@@ i@@ me and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ firm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is c@@ r@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing at the do@@ or , and its c@@ ra@@ ving is to d@@ om@@ in@@ ate you ; but will you get the ma@@ st@@ er@@ y over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”

Like that p@@ il@@ o@@ t , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?

The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not un@@ righteous so as to for@@ get your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .

I was born in a one - ro@@ om lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small to@@ wn called Li@@ ber@@ ty , In@@ di@@ an@@ a , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
Later , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
D@@ U@@ R@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much changed .
The to@@ wn of Li@@ ber@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by small f@@ ar@@ ms , and the ba@@ sic cro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the Bap@@ ti@@ st c@@ hurch every S@@ un@@ day .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my care@@ er .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Con@@ gre@@ gation B@@ ook Stu@@ d@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ear@@ s before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a was a j@@ e@@ we@@ l then , and she is a j@@ e@@ we@@ l today .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a and I got married in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ r@@ ak@@ er , inter@@ vie@@ wed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
M@@ ost of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three do@@ l@@ l@@ ars a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ l@@ ori@@ a did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we st@@ opp@@ ed at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’s daughter and her husband .
M@@ other and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ lan ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that promo@@ tes rac@@ is@@ m and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 196@@ 2 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try School at S@@ outh L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New York .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so g@@ la@@ d that I did not take that jo@@ b !
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ ori@@ a re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the re@@ st of the day , some@@ times until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f , we ap@@ plied to become special pioneers .
Brother Le@@ on We@@ av@@ er , now the co@@ or@@ din@@ ator of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Tho@@ mp@@ son was the first dis@@ tri@@ ct overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to G@@ l@@ ori@@ a , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a to@@ wn we were visi@@ ting in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a was a j@@ e@@ we@@ l when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appointed to be a member of the Go@@ ver@@ ning B@@ ody .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and sec@@ ur@@ ity . ”
S@@ ec@@ ond , we must pray for God’s holy spirit .
If the house is deser@@ ving , let the peace you wish it come up@@ on it ; but if it is not deser@@ ving , let the peace from you return up@@ on you . ”
So I gre@@ et@@ ed her in her own t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
T@@ ak@@ en by surpris@@ e , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I p@@ ol@@ it@@ ely told her that I w@@ ished to see the H@@ i@@ gh Com@@ mission@@ er .
She tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ ed the offi@@ cial , who came out to meet me and gre@@ et@@ ed me in the local language .
After that , he care@@ fully listen@@ ed to me as I explained to him the pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful activities of the Witnesses . ”

When we re@@ turned , pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by asked , ‘ What happened ?
Why are you determined to “ bear fru@@ it with end@@ ur@@ ance ” ?
